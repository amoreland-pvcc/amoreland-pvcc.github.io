    <h1> Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h1>

    <h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phase 1: Understand the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</li>
        <li>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropriate language based on the algorithm</li>
        <li>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</li>
        <li>Phase 5: Execute the program</li>
        <li>Phase 6: Test the program, find errors and debug, then retest</li>
        <li>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Programming structures</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sequential structure: Top-down execution</li>
        <li>Decision structures: if/then/else</li>
        <li>Iterative (Looping):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>while loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
            <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
            <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Recursive structures:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</li>
            <li>repetition continues until:</li>
            <ul>
                degenerative case, which is a termination condition, is met (degenerative case is also called a "base
                case")
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Two classic programming/database problems</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order</li>
        <ul>
            <li>sorting numbers</li>
            <li>sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Searching: find specific data that met a certain criteria</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In database:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Two popular seach techniques:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Sequential search: search from top or bottom to top, one item at a time</li>
            <li>Binary search:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                <li>start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3> Two classic program goals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</li>
        <li>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</li>
    </ul>
