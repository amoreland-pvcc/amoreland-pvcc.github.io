This page will describe my various projects in my CSC 110 class, and what I learned from each of them.

## Hello World

> This was the first coding assignment of the class where we learned to code in **HTML**. I learned the basics of how most elements start. An example would be with the element &lt;html&gt; and then end with &lt;/html&gt;. In thi simplified version of html, there is the head and the body. The head is where data is placed that will not be put in the actual webpage, but instead shows up in the title bar. It is also where you can pre-define scripts that will show up in the body. The body is where you code what will be the main content on the webpage for people to see.

> This is where the idea of lists were introduced. This includes ordered and unordered lists. This is also where the idea of details inside of an element where introduced. This assignment was basically throw things against a wall and hope it sticks, but a guided version of it. Inserting images onto a page was also introduced in this section.

## Brownsville Bagels

> This is where the idea of different types of headings were first introduced and it also helped to further familiarize the use of HTML lists. This site contains a makeshift menu of a bagel shop and their various items on the menu.
